    <h2>Our magical formula customizes your needs to ensure grand results</h2>
        <p>We understand the value of online review websites - but many are businesses struggle to balance this priority among all the other jobs the teams are juggling on a daily basis.  Some businesses have restructured their organizational charts and hired dedicated Reputation Managers, most have assigned the task to a member of management who was hired because of their expertise in other areas. </p>
        <p>Juggling all these duties can often take time away from your Managers and other leaders who are best served interacting with the guests and managing the team. </p>

        <ul>
        <li>Providing timely, genuine and strategic responses to all reviews</li>
<li>Developing strategies to drive the quality and quantity of your online reviews</li>
<li>Monitoring positive and negative trending topics as highlighted in reviews and providing detail to your team which can be identified as Unique Selling Points, or areas of focus for improving the business</li>
<li>Reviewing what is being said about your business on Social Media outlets, blogs and in the media</li>
<li>Analyzing frequency of reviews and scores of competition</li>
        </ul>
